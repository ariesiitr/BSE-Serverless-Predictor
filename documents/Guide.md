# Syllabus

This document contains an overall learning syllabus that will be helpful if you choose to pursue a career in
Quantitative Finance.

At a high level there are three main topics in which you need to build skills:

1. Research
2. Finance
3. Software Engineering 

Below for each of these fields I've provided links under various sub-topics to the things that I believe to be
important to know.

This syllabus is meant to be a guide rather than a definitive list, the expectation is that you will modify it
and customize it to your own long-term learning plan. 

Good Luck!
